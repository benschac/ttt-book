# Introduction

![Tic Tac Token App](./img/ttt-app.png)

Over the course of this curriculum, we'll learn the basics of Solidity and Ethereum from the ground up and build an interactive web3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. We'll learn about ERC20 tokens, NFTs, and other Ethereum abstractions. Finally we'll deploy our smart contracts to Polygon, an EVM-compatible blockchain with fast, cheap transactions, and host our interactive frontend on IPFS, a distributed peer-to-peer filesystem. 

The content in this book is intended as a supplement to a series of hands on workshops. We typically cover one chapter per week.
