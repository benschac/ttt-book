# ðŸ–¼ NFTs

## Introducing NFTs
Last week we added support for multiple simultaneous games, built out a leaderboard to track wins, and created our own ERC20 token to award to winners. This week, we'll explore another smart contract standard: ERC721, the Ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Over the course of this chapter, we'll create and issue a unique token to each player, then add a dynamic SVG image that shows the current state of the game board.

#### Goals this week
- Learn about the ERC721 nonfungible token standard.
- Understand off chain vs. on chain metadata.
- Create and issue an ERC721 token to the players in each game.

#### Suggested homework
- Read the [ERC-721 nonfungible token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).
- Read a few implementations of ERC721: [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.6.0/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol), [Solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC721.sol)
- Try the "Simple NFT Example" and "SVG NFT" challenges on [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
