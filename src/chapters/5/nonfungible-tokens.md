# Nonfungible tokens

NFTs are in the zeitgeist right now: perhaps you've seen punks, apes and penguins taking over Twitter profiles, or watched a [dog JPEG](https://fractional.art/vaults/the-doge-nft) sell for $4 million. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how NFTs work—and we'll shoehorn them into our Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## What are nonfungible tokens?

Unlike fungible ERC20s, NFTs represent unique entities. They are still _tokens_—ownable, transferrable assets whose ownership is recorded on a digital ledger—but they aren't interchangeable or divisible like ERC20s. A nonfungible token has unique characteristics that mean one token is not the same as another. Like all tokens, they are an abstraction that can be used to represent many things:

- Collectibles, like [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)
- Artwork, like [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/)
- Ownership over real world assets, like a digital deed
- Obligations, like loans
- Voting rights or governance power
- Skills and reputation, like [lvl protocol](https://www.lvlprotocol.xyz/)
- Domain names, like [ENS domains](https://app.ens.domains/)
- Unique instances of a Tic Tac Toe game.

Although there's a lot of hype in the NFT market right now, they are a composable building block that can be much more than a monkey JPEG.
