# About Solidity
Over the course of these workshops, we're going to be learning [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/), the main smart contract programming language used on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), the most popular general purpose programmable blockchain. Solidity works anywhere the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) does, and there are growing number of EVM-compatible blockchains that support Solidity contracts.

For the first few weeks we won't spend too much time on Ethereum fundamentals. Instead, we'll treat Solidity like any other programming language without worrying too much about the execution environment. However, those details will start to creep in as we proceed through these workshops. If you want a really good grounding in Ethereum (or a review), I recommend [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook), which is available for free online.

> The official Solidity documentation at [https://docs.soliditylang.org/](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) is an excellent, readable resource for getting started with the language. I recommend reading it end to end.
