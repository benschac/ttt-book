# ðŸ›  Setup

## Getting Started
Week 1 is focused on getting a Solidity programming environment set up and starting to explore the language. We'll introduce Foundry, a toolchain for Ethereum development, and write our first unit tests in Solidity. Then we'll explore some more powerful features, like fuzz tests and symbolic execution.

#### Goals this week
- Set up a Solidity programming environment using Foundry
- Get comfortable writing and running tests using `forge`
- Start exploring Solidity syntax by analogy to other languages

#### Suggested homework
- Read through the [Basics](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) and [Language Description](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#) sections of the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/index.html).
- Pick a [TDD kata](https://kata-log.rocks/tdd) (Prime Factors, Roman Numerals, Change Maker, Bowling Game, etc.), and implement it in Solidity.
